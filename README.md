Boostcharging is proposed as a new, ultra-fast, recharging algorithm for batteries. Characteristic for boostcharging is that nearly empty batteries can be recharged with very high currents for a short period of time. Cycle life of batteries, boostcharged and additionally standard charged to full capacity do not introduce any negative degradation effects. Boostcharging is shown to be very rapid compared to standard CCCV method which you can also find my model for it here:

In this model I have build a Boost charger on simulink that simulates this method and can be used to study and simulate this charging method maybe in a bigger system.
